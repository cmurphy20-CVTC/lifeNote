# lifeNote
A website app to organize and save the information users need

This is a web app I created to help remember things! When I had first started making this, our first child was born and life became a little more chaotic. I wanted to challenge myself and build an app to help me and others remember the various people or things we encounter on the day to day. I was doing a Udemy course on web development that taught basic CRUD operations for a Node.js site using MongoDB. From there I built my own app that that allows users to create an account and create notes about different topics. For example, I want to learn more about investing so with LifeNote I can create a note about the difference between stocks and bonds. In the future I can also edit that note with more information or delete it if needed. I also added a feature where users are able to search notes by title to save on scrolling! This app was quite the challenge since I have primary used SQL in the past. MongoDB is lightweight and easier to make changes to the database, but creating  relationships is harder than in SQL. I want to share this about with people and hope it helps organize their lives a little bit. 

Technologies Used

For a responsive modern looking website I used Bootstrap so that the content will resize for various screens. The pages were created utilizing HTML and the content was formatted with CSS. I also used jQuery for some custom animations. For the server side I used Express and Node.js to build the server and the routes. Passport.js was used to protect user passwords and for authentication. For the database MongoDB and Mongoose were utilized.

Features

Users are able to create their own accounts and their passwords which are protected by salting and hashing from Passport.JS. Then users can login to access their account and notes. LifeNote allows users to create, update and delete their notes. There are easy to follow instructions and navigation to guide the user. There is also a search bar at the top of the home page to search for notes. I utilized packages like Passport

Challenges
There was a learning curve for using Node.js and MongoDB in this app. I have used SQL in the past and it is easier to buidl relationships between different items in an app. However, MongoDB is much more flexible with making changes to the database. I fell into the trap of coming up with too many features for the app and...
