# lifeNote
A website app to organize and save the information users need

This is a web app I created to help remember things! When I had first started making this, our first child was born and life became a little more chaotic. I wanted to challenge myself and build an app to help me and others remember the various people or things we encounter on the day to day. I was doing a Udemy course on web development that taught basic CRUD operations for a Node.js site using MongoDB. From there I built my own app that that allows users to create an account and create notes about different topics. For example, I want to learn more about investing so with LifeNote I can create a note about the difference between stocks and bonds. In the future I can also edit that note with more information or delete it if needed. I also added a feature where users are able to search notes by title to save on scrolling! This app was quite the challenge since I have primary used MySQL in the past. MongoDB is lightweight and easier to make changes to the database, but creating  relationships is harder than in SQL. I want to share this about with people and hope it helps organize their lives a little bit. 

Technologies Used

For a responsive modern looking website I used Bootstrap so that the content will resize for various screens. The pages were created utilizing HTML and the content was formatted with CSS. I also used jQuery for some custom animations. For the server side I used Express and Node.js to build the server and the routes. I utilized the packages nodemailer to create a form users can contact me with and Passport.js for protecting users passwords and user authentication. 

Features

Users are able to create their own accounts an login to access their account and notes. LifeNote allows users to create, update and delete their notes. There are easy to follow instructions and navigation to guide the user. There is also a search bar at the top of the home page to search for notes. I utilized packages like Passport..............

Challenges

Early on in development I fell into the trap of coming up with too many features. My time could have been better spent sticking with the core features of the app of creating, updating and deleting notes along with the user login system. Another challenge was the learning curve for using Node.js and MongoDB. I have used MySQL in the past and it is easier to build relationships between items in the database. However, there are no transactions in this app and MongoDB is fair easier and more flexible to work with user data. Using Mongoose with MongoDB makes it even easier to interact with the database. This process took a lot of time researching and testing to accomplish the necessary features. I see these challenges a learnign opportunity since I have a better idea of my current capabilities, managing my time and researching documentation.
